## Why EOV6

When a call moves to the phone, spelling names and emails is slow and error-prone. EOV6 gives the agent a short code the caller enters at **eov6.com** to share verified contact details and chat, stored ephemerally and deleted by policy.

## How it works
1. **Agent opens a session** → gets a short code.
2. **Caller enters the code** at eov6.com → a simple, secure chat opens.
3. **Send details** → caller pushes full name, email and phone in one tap (agents can “Ask name/email/phone”).
4. **Auto-expire** → session TTL clears data by design.

## What’s live today
- Agent console with live chat and canned prompts.
- Caller page with “Send details” (name, email, phone).
- Session lifecycle: create, chat, end, TTL.
- Google sign-in for agents (subdomains authorized).
- Vercel deploy + custom domain (marketing + app).

## Near-term roadmap
- **Org-level uploads** (images/PDFs) with strict TTL (toggle per org).
- Consent & T&Cs checkbox + audit line.
- Billing portal (usage-based).
- Org admin, canned prompt libraries, optional webhook/CRM integration.

## Privacy & security
- **Ephemeral by default**: TTL purges sessions automatically.
- **Least-data**: name, email, phone, and messages only.
- **Org controls**: features like uploads are opt-in per org.
- **Separation**: caller is anonymous; agents use Google SSO.

## Why now
- Call centers waste minutes per call on spelling and verification.
- EOV6 shortens handle time, reduces rework, and improves data quality.
