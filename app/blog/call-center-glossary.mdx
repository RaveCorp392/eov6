# Call Center Glossary: Key Metrics, Acronyms, and What They Really Mean

If you work in a contact center or manage customer experience, you’ve probably heard terms like **FCR** or **CSAT** thrown around. But not everyone wants to admit they’re fuzzy on the details.  
This glossary cuts through the jargon and explains why each metric matters.

---

## FCR — First Call Resolution
- **Meaning:** The percentage of customer issues resolved on the very first call, without transfers or follow-ups.  
- **Why it matters:** Higher FCR means lower cost per contact and happier customers. It’s one of the strongest predictors of customer satisfaction.

---

## CSAT — Customer Satisfaction Score
- **Meaning:** A simple survey measure (“How satisfied were you with this interaction?”), usually on a 1–5 scale.  
- **Why it matters:** CSAT is the most direct way to track how customers *feel* about your service. Improving clarity during calls often lifts CSAT quickly.

---

## NPS — Net Promoter Score
- **Meaning:** A measure of customer loyalty based on the question “How likely are you to recommend us?” scored -100 to +100.  
- **Why it matters:** High NPS signals customers aren’t just satisfied — they’re advocates. Inconsistent communication drags this score down.

---

## AHT — Average Handle Time
- **Meaning:** The average duration of a call, including talk time and after-call work.  
- **Why it matters:** Shorter isn’t always better. The goal is balance: efficient calls that still resolve issues. Tools that improve clarity often reduce wasted minutes.

---

## CES — Customer Effort Score
- **Meaning:** A survey metric: “How easy was it to resolve your issue?”  
- **Why it matters:** High effort kills loyalty. Misheard details or repeated spelling raise effort dramatically.

---

## QA — Quality Assurance
- **Meaning:** Internal review of agent interactions (often scored with rubrics).  
- **Why it matters:** Ensures compliance, coaching, and consistency. QA teams love clarity tools that reduce repeat errors.

---

## IVR — Interactive Voice Response
- **Meaning:** The automated phone menus (“Press 1 for billing”).  
- **Why it matters:** Still the gateway to most call centers. Poor IVR routing hurts FCR from the start.

# Why share this?
Because language matters. If your team understands the metrics, they can improve them.  
At **EOV6**, we focus on clarity during the call — and that clarity flows straight into **higher FCR, higher CSAT, and lower AHT**.
