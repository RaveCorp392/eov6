# Why Clarity Matters: The Hidden Cost of Misheard Calls (and a 76% wake-up stat)

If a customer spells their email three times and you still don’t have it, **you don’t have a product problem—you have a clarity problem**.  
Clarity is the quiet force behind **First-Call Resolution (FCR)** and **CSAT**.

> **The 76% stat:** Research widely cited in customer service circles shows that **76% of consumers would stop doing business after just one bad support experience**.  
> That’s a jaw-dropper—**one** poor interaction can end the relationship.

*(Editor’s note: keep this stat with a live citation link in production. Place the link at the first mention above.)*

## The two minutes that matter most

Most calls go off the rails in the same place: **the critical details**.

- Names and emails get misheard.  
- Addresses and order numbers get mangled.  
- Accents, line quality, or background noise compound the problem.

Those 120 seconds of “sorry, could you repeat that?” crush FCR and annoy customers.

## The fix that doesn’t need a deployment

**EOV6** adds a tiny, temporary text channel to the live call—**no installs, no new system**.  
The agent gives a **6-digit code**; the customer opens a secure browser page and **types** the critical bits. When the call ends, the chat **disappears**.

**What changes immediately:**

- **FCR rises** — the right details on the first try.  
- **CSAT lifts** — customers feel understood.  
- **Agent stress drops** — fewer painful repeats and escalations.

## “Isn’t that just live chat?”

Not exactly. This is **chat as a clarity layer** *for the current phone call*, not a parallel channel.  
It’s a **two-minute assist**, then it’s gone.

## Try it on your next hard call

1. Go to **eov6.com** and generate a code in the agent console.  
2. Ask the caller to enter it.  
3. Have them type the tricky details (email, address, order number).  
4. Close the session; it vanishes.

You’ll feel the difference—**and so will your customer**.
