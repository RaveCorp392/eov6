# Hypothetical Scenario — Government Contact Center

> **Disclaimer:** Scenario-based illustration for explanatory purposes only. Not an actual deployment or measured result.

## Context
A state services hotline supports a multicultural population. Agents need a way to confirm PII accurately without retaining data.

## Approach
Agents offer a **temporary EOV6 chat** to type names, emails, or addresses during the call. The chat is ephemeral—no content persists after the session ends.

## Expected impact
- **Inclusive service:** Help constituents be understood regardless of language or accent.
- **Privacy by default:** Reduced data-retention footprint for sensitive interactions.
- **Operational ease:** Browser-based rollout; no desktop installs.

> **Note:** For verification and approvals, a security brief and pilot plan are recommended prior to production use.
