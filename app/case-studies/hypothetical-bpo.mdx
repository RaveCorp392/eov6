# Hypothetical Scenario — BPO Contact Center

> **Disclaimer:** This is a scenario-based illustration for explanatory purposes only. It does not describe an actual customer or measured outcomes.

## Context
A 500-seat BPO supports retail customers in North America from Manila. Agents report frequent miscommunication on names, emails, and addresses, leading to repeat calls and escalations.

## Approach
Supervisors enable **EOV6** as a light “clarity layer.” When an agent senses friction, they share a 6-digit code. The caller opens a temporary chat in their browser and types the critical details.

## Expected impact
- **Higher FCR:** Typing critical info avoids mishearing; first calls resolve more often.
- **Lower AHT (when it matters):** Clarifying details quickly prevents long back-and-forth.
- **Happier agents & customers:** Reduced frustration on both sides.

## Example flow
1. Agent: “Could you please open eov6.com and enter code **482931**?”
2. Caller types their email; agent confirms spelling instantly.
3. Issue resolved on the first call; session ends and data disappears.
