# Hypothetical Scenario — Global SMB

> **Disclaimer:** This is a scenario-based illustration. It is not a real customer or guaranteed outcome.

## Context
A 15-person ecommerce company supports customers in English from multiple regions. Occasional language barriers stall sales or support calls.

## Approach
When clarity slips, the rep shares a **6-digit EOV6 code**. Customer opens a browser chat to type product names, addresses, or order numbers.

## Expected impact
- **Saved sales:** No more losing a deal due to misheard details.
- **Fewer follow-ups:** Fewer “just to confirm spelling” emails/calls.
- **Professional experience:** Customers see you going the extra mile for clarity.
