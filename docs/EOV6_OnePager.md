# EOV6 ‚Äì One Pager

## Problem
Call center and service interactions are often unclear, hard to follow, and prone to errors.  
- Customers repeat details; agents mishear; miscommunication increases cost and dissatisfaction.  
- Outbound calls with interpreters are slow and disruptive.  
- Inbound queues often lose continuity (ID‚Äôing a customer twice, long scripts).  
This wastes time, reduces satisfaction, and drives turnover.

## Solution
EOV6 provides a **6-digit connect code** to instantly link a caller with a secure chat channel visible to both customer and agent.  
- Caller enters code ‚Üí chat opens.  
- Agent sees caller details and transcript in real time.  
- Secure ephemeral session: cleared when ended.  
- **Translation Add-On**: instant text translation across languages, replacing expensive human interpreters.  

## Features
- 6-digit session code entry (caller + agent connect instantly).  
- Shared chat window with role separation.  
- Caller detail form (name, email, phone).  
- File upload (PDF/images) tied to session.  
- **Translation Add-On (chat only)** ‚Äì $2 per session or $20/agent/mo unlimited.  
- Ephemeral: all data auto-cleared when session ends.  
- Firebase-backed, Vercel-hosted: secure, scalable, lightweight.

## Benefits
- Reduces repetition and errors.  
- Provides written transcript alongside calls.

## Market
- Call centers (BPOs, insurance, banking, utilities).  
- Enterprises with high call volumes.  
- IT support & service desks needing continuity between phone + chat.  
- SMBs with global or multilingual customers.  

## Business Model

- Tiered pricing by seat or session volume.  
- Translation Add-On:

## Traction / Current Status
