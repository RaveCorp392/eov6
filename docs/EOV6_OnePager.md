# EOV6 – One Pager

## Problem
Call center interactions are often unclear, hard to follow, and prone to errors. Customers repeat details; agents mishear; miscommunication increases cost and dissatisfaction.

## Solution
EOV6 provides a **6-digit connect code** to instantly link a caller with a secure chat channel visible to both customer and agent.  
- Caller enters code → chat opens.  
- Agent sees caller details and transcript.  
- Secure ephemeral session: cleared when ended.

## Features
- 6-digit session code entry.
- Shared chat window (caller + agent).
- Caller details form (name/email/phone).
- File upload (PDF/images).
- Role separation: caller vs agent UI.
- Firebase-backed: secure ephemeral storage.

## Benefits
- Reduces repetition and errors.
- Provides written transcript alongside call.
- Supports compliance and clarity.
- Lightweight, no-install, web-based.

## Market
- Call centers (BPOs, insurance, banking, utilities).
- Enterprises with high call volumes.
- SMBs outsourcing support.

## Business Model
- SaaS subscription for call centers.
- Tiered pricing by seat or session volume.

## Traction / Current Status
- MVP live with session/chat/file upload.
- Firebase + Vercel deployment.
- In-progress: polish of UI + file link display.
