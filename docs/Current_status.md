## ‚úÖ Successes (working features)

1. **Session Management**
   - Session IDs now display on both agent and caller screens.
   - Sessions are persisted and displayed consistently in the URL.

2. **Chat Window**
   - Agent/caller role separation is working.
   - Autoscroll is functioning correctly (chat always shows the latest messages).
   - Dark mode styling is consistent.

3. **File Upload**
   - File upload now works: files appear in Firebase Storage under `/uploads/{sessionId}/`.
   - Upload button shows confirmation ("Uploaded").
   - Upload path includes session ID, ensuring isolation per session.

4. **General UI**
   - Secure shared chat header is clean.
   - Ephemeral notice is visible and styled.
   - Chat input and send button are functional.
   - Caller/agent labels appear correctly in chat messages.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues / Next Fixes

1. **Uploads in Chat**
   - Uploaded files do not display in the chat stream (agent can‚Äôt see/download).
   - Goal: automatically post a chat message with file link after upload completes.

2. **Double Upload Buttons**
   - Two ‚ÄúChoose file‚Äù inputs are showing.
   - Likely duplicate render in `FileUploader.tsx` or duplicate mount in caller/agent pages.
   - Goal: only one input visible.

3. **Caller Details**
   - Caller-side (non-agent) screen does not show form fields for:
     - Name
     - Email
     - Phone
   - As a result, agent side placeholders remain blank.
   - Goal: reinstate caller details form.

4. **Investor Docs Packaging**
   - Zip packaging failed.
   - Markdown docs exist individually but couldn‚Äôt be bundled/exported as zip here.
   - Workaround: inline docs and recreate them locally.

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Patch `FileUploader.tsx` to send a chat message with file download URL after upload.
2. Fix duplicate upload inputs.
3. Add back caller-side detail form.
4. Inline investor docs and commit.
5. Reattempt PDF export of one-pager + wireframes separately.

## Notes
- Overall progress: strong.  
- We have working chat, session, role separation, file uploads (storage side), and styling.  
- Remaining items are polish + visibility fixes.
